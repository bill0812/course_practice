## üëâ Let's have some discussion

* For first question, we use the opencv tool to make each character in the image closed, and also use that closed image to find boundary of each character.

    + For closing operation, we use __„Äå morphologyEx „Äç__ funciton, and match the __„Äå cv.MORPH_CLOSE „Äç__ and __„Äå kernel with 5*5 „Äç__ to close each character in the image.

     + For finding boundaries, we also use __„Äå morphologyEx „Äç__ funciton, and match the __„Äå cv.MORPH_GRADIENT „Äç__ and __„Äå kernel with 3*3 „Äç__ to find each character's boundary in the image.

* For second question : 

    + we first find the histogram, then use the __„Äå for loop „Äç__ to caculate the amount of each value ( 1 - 255 ), and also use the __formula to equalize the histogram__. Finally, we map the value between original one and transfered one. 
    
    + Besides, we use the opencv tool __„Äå cv.equalizeHist „Äç__ to get a equalized image.

    + Having this two images from different ways, we use __„Äå MSE „Äç__ /  __„Äå RMSE „Äç__ to calculate the error ( loss ) between the two, and output the __json file__

* For third question, we use different to compare different output :

    + First is __„Äå Histogram Equaliztion „Äç__, using the opencv tool to show the output

    + Second is __„Äå Gamma Correlation  „Äç__, which teacher mentioned in class before. And we using the map table to transform the original histogram ( original value ). And for the value "Gamma", we choose 0.7 which I thought the result is better among all

    + Third, we also use the concept that teacher also mentioned in class before, which called __„Äå CLAHE ( Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization ) „Äç__, by using the opencv tool to get the oupt. And for the parameters, one is "clipLimit" which I set 3.0 ; one is "tileGridSize", which I choose (8,8).And as for the purpose of setting this two parameters, we can see the paper, and understand those two :

        
        - Clip Limit :

        - Tile Grid Size :
        
            ![](https://i.imgur.com/zHlEz6u.png)

    + After those three method, we combine four images, and compare to each one, I found that the image from the third method is much better than other. That means, it shows more detail of the images and more clear than others.
